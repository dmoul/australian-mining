    "text": "Introduction\nMining is the largest sector of the Australian economy: 14.6% as of July 20231. In these pages I explore Australian mining output using data compiled by Gavin Mudd and described in A Comprehensive dataset for Australian mine production 1799 to 2021 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02275-z. The data includes metals (e.g., gold, silver), ores (e.g., bauxite, iron ore), energy resources (coal), and gemstones (e.g., diamonds).\nI wanted to know:\nTo answer the first question here: The top three commodities by mass in 2021 were iron ore, coal, and bauxite, together making up about 97% of 2021 production (Figure 1.1, Table 1.1). In terms of value, the top three were iron ore, coal, and gold with a combined value of about 88% of the total value of production (Figure 3.1, Table 3.1).\nCommenting on “Table 5 Cumulative Australian mine production by major time period and metal and mineral”, Mudd notes2:\nThe paper includes specific notes on each commodity, which I will not repeat here. Most amounts are expressed in the mass unit dry metric tonnes: \\(1\\ tonne = 1\\ Mg = 10^6 g\\). In plots showing amounts, units are appended to the product name: tonnes (t), kg, and carets."

    "text": "Limitations\nWhile Mudd provided 223 years of data, I use only the most recent 100 years (1922-2021), which is the period for which I have Consumer Price Index data from the Reserve Bank of Australia and thus can convert prices and value to constant 2021 dollars.\nI did not attempt to reconcile numbers in this analysis with data published elsewhere. They are unlikely to match for the following reasons:\n\nI have not distinguished among the amounts mined, produced (which may include imports beneficieated or otherwise processed in Australia), and exported (some output is consumed domestically).\nRather than using CPI, one could choose other measures of inflation more centered on mining or manufacturing. I chose CPI, because it’s the measure for which the RBA provides 100 years of data. It’s also the most common and familiar measure.\nI excluded Platinum Group Elements (PGEs), Rare Earth Elements, Niobium, Bismuth, Gallium, and Vanadium due to small quantities mined, insufficient data points, incomplete data series as noted by the author, or the need for more involved data preparation to present them accurately.\nMudd made some generalizing assumptions documented in A Comprehensive dataset for Australian mine production 1799 to 2021 and in the master spreadsheet; see [From the Notes sheet]\n\nIf any numbers seem wildly erroneous, please let me know."

    "text": "1.2 Output per year by commodity\nThe output per year plots for each commodity is the sum of the output of all mines producing that commodity–which can vary significantly over short time periods. Mudd explains1:\n\nThe process of mining can be simplified to the following: mineral exploration finds a notable deposit of economic potential, approvals for mining are sought and obtained, the mine is built and begins operations, the deposit is eventually depleted or becomes uneconomic and the mine is closed and the site rehabilitated, and the cycle begins again …. Mining operations can be conducted through open pit or underground techniques, producing ‘ore’ which contains economic concentrations of the target metals or minerals as well as ‘waste rock’ with low to uneconomic concentrations of metals or minerals. The ore is processed to produce a saleable product such as a metal-rich concentrate (e.g., copper, nickel, lead, zinc or tin-rich concentrates), beneficiated mineral concentrate (e.g., saleable iron ore, beneficiated bauxite, washed coal) or metallic product (e.g., gold-silver doré bars, copper metal). After removal of the saleable product, the remaining minerals are called ‘tailings’ and are typically discharged to an engineered storage dam while waste rock is usually placed in large piles.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nproduct_levels <- dta_yearly_long |>\n  filter(!is.na(mass)) |>\n  slice_max(order_by = mass, n = 1,\n            by = product_mass) |>\n  arrange(desc(mass)) |>\n  pull(product_mass)\n\ndta_yearly_long |>\n  mutate(product_mass = factor(product_mass, levels = product_levels)) |>\n  ggplot(aes(year, mass, color = product_mass)) +\n  geom_line(na.rm = TRUE, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1900, 1950, 2000)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()),\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ product_mass, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(\n    title = glue(\"Australian mining output\"),\n    subtitle = glue(\"Arranged by highest to lowest peak amounts {year_first}-{year_last}\"),\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Amount (Y axis scale varies)\",\n    caption = my_caption\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Output over 100 years"

According to Geosciences Australia, a government agency, Japan is the the destination of more Australian coal then any other country, followed by China (assuming post-COVID-19 industrial activity returns to trend), then India, South Korea, and Taiwan. See Figure 92.\nThe main use of Bauxite and Alumina is in aluminium smelting. Another name for alumina is aluminium oxide (\\(Al_2O_3\\)) and Aluminium(III) oxide3. In North American English aluminium is aluminum.\nGiven the insatiable demand for batteries, it’s not surprising that lithium mining has increased dramatically over the last 30-40 years.\n\n\n\nShow the code\npeak_products <- dta_yearly_long |>\n  filter(year == max(year, na.rm = TRUE) & mass >= mass_max * peak_production_cutoff) \n\ndata_for_plot <- dta_yearly_long |>\n  inner_join(peak_products %>% select(product_mass),\n             by = \"product_mass\")\n\nlabels_for_plot <- data_for_plot |>\n  filter(!is.na(mass)) |>\n  mutate(final_year = max(year),\n         .by = product_mass) |>\n  filter(year == max(year),\n         .by = product_mass)\n  \ndata_for_plot |>\n  ggplot(aes(year, mass, color = product_mass, group = product_mass)) +\n  geom_line(na.rm = TRUE, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = labels_for_plot,\n                  aes(max(year) + 30, mass, label = product_mass),\n                  hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, show.legend = FALSE, \n                  direction = \"y\", force = 0.4) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1850, 1900, 1950, 2000)) +\n  scale_y_log10(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()),\n                limits = c(1, NA)) +\n  labs(\n    title = glue(\"Commodities near peak output in Australia\"),\n    subtitle = glue(\"{year_first}-{year_last}\"),\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Amount (log10 scale)\",\n    caption = my_caption\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Products at or near peak production: yearly Australian mining output"

    "text": "From the Notes sheet\nThe author provided the following on the “Notes” sheet\nKey Assumptions & Points to Note:\n\nAll sources used adopted their own quality control and can be considered reliable for the purposes of this compilation.\nData represents the contained metal or minerals within a saleable product leaving a mine gate (e.g., contained metal or minerals in concentrates, doré bars, direct shipping ore, refined metal, saleable ore). (Note: contained metal is not the same as payable metal, which is what a mine gets paid for after deductions by a smelter / refinery).\nWhere necessary, mineral products have been converted to show contained metal (or element / elements) (e.g., tungsten in wolfram or scheelite, individual platinum group elements).\nAll prices are indicative export prices only, based on reported metal or mineral content, presented as unit price ($/t).\nMonetary values have been converted to Australian dollars ($), with £ multiplied by 2 to give $.\nEvery effort has been made to avoid double counting, but there may still be some data overlap.\nAll units are metric (e.g., 1 tonne is 1 million grams; g/t are grams per tonne; % is per cent; kt is thousand tonnes; Mt is mega or million tonnes); except diamonds which are in carats (where 1 carat = 0.2 grams).\nThe vast majority of data is calendar year, but from the 1980s onwards some data is financial year (i.e., July to June).\nWhere value only was reported, this has been converted to metal / mineral based on average prices for that year.\nWhilst every effort has been made to reconcile conflicting data sources, some conflicts and inconsistencies remain - if there is a need to address this, please contact the author.\nIt is anticipated that additional updates will be included in future (e.g., years beyond 2021, additional minerals) - if there is a desire for help with particular research or analyses, the author is most willing to be consulted and may be able to help.\nVery minor differences remain between mine production time series (e.g., mined Cu production in column BP) and totals in the Summary or Mine by Mine tabs.\nAny errors - or even additional data to amend or add - please contact the author.\n\nand this:\n\nNote: This synthesis does not include industrial and construction minerals and materials (e.g., aggregates, sand, barite, limestone, clays, dimension stone, etc)."

    "text": "“Annual data” sheet\nI focused on the “Annual Data” sheet.\nTo create unique column names, I appended the contents of row 8, 9, and 10. For example\nGold\nQLD\nkg Au\nbecomes Gold_QLD_kg AU.\nThis works everywhere except the \\(ThO_2\\) phosphate mineral Monazite_WA_%ThO2, which is repeated in columns 353 and 358 row 10. The first time it refers to monazite but the second time to monazite in WA grouped with xenotime (both “…are sometimes grouped in the informal ‘anhydrous phosphates’ group”) xenotime. So I manually appended “xenotime” in cell MT10 to get Monazite_WA_%ThO2_xenotime.\nAlthough I eventually excluded these items, in order to parse the spreadsheet, I un-merged cells in row 8 and copied the relevant string to each of the merged cells:\n\nPlacer Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) in GW8:HA8\nPlacer Osmiridium in HB8:HF8\nPlacer Osmiridium [sic] in HG8:HK8\nPGEs from Nickel Sulphides in HL8:HN8\nPlatinum Group Elements by Individual Element in HO8:HT8\n\nData for diamonds in 2021 is missing (cells BT233, BV233, BX233). Since production has been on a downward trend since 2017, I estimated 2021 production by averaging the decline the prior two years and subtracting it from 2020 production.\nIn the spreadsheet Ilminite in year 1932 (cell JV144) has character data rather than number in the cell, which converted to NA (missing data). “Ilmenite is the most important ore of titanium and the main source of titanium dioxide, which is used in paints, printing inks, fabrics, plastics, paper, sunscreen, food and cosmetics.”1"
