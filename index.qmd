Mining is the largest sector of the Australian economy: 14.6% as of July 2023^[<https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/snapshots/economy-composition-snapshot/> retrieved 2023-07-21; see also "In numbers: how mining came to be Australiaâ€™s most profitable sector" by JP Casey Published 15 March, 2021 <https://www.mining-technology.com/features/in-numbers-how-mining-came-to-be-australias-most-profitable-sector/> retrieved 2023-07-21 ]. In these pages I explore Australian mining output using data compiled by Gavin Mudd and described in *A Comprehensive dataset for Australian mine production 1799 to 2021* <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02275-z>. The data includes metals (e.g., gold, silver), ores (e.g., bauxite, iron ore), energy resources (coal), and gemstones (e.g., diamonds).

The top three commodities by mass in 2021 were iron ore, coal, and bauxite, together making up about 97% of 2021 production (@fig-amount-2021). In terms of value, the top three were iron ore, coal, and gold with a combined value of about 88% of the total value of production (@fig-value-2021).

Commenting on "Table 5 Cumulative Australian mine production by major time period and metal and mineral", Mudd notes^[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02275-z ]:

>For Table [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02275-z/tables/5)), the two most important observations are the increasing diversity of metals and minerals produced over time and the rapidly increasing scales of production across most commodities.

The paper includes specific notes on each metal/mineral, which I will not repeat here. Most mass units are dry metric tonnes: $1\ tonne = 1\ Mg = 10^6 g$ with adjustments where original data reported wet metric tons. In plots showing amounts, units are appended to the product name: tonnes (t), kg, and carets.

## Limitations

While Mudd provided 223 years of data, I use only the most recent 100 years (1922-2021), which is the period for which I have Consumer Price Index data from the Reserve Bank of Australia and thus can convert prices and value to constant 2021 dollars.

I did not attempt to reconcile numbers in this analysis with data published elsewhere. They are unlikely to match for the following reasons:

* I have not distinguished among the amounts *mined*, *produced* (which may include imports beneficieated or otherwise processed in Australia), and *exported* (some output is consumed domestically).
* I excluded [Platinum Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_group) Elements (PGEs), [Rare Earth Elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_element), Niobium, Bismuth, Gallium, and Vanadium due to small quantities mined, insufficient data points, incomplete data series as noted by the author, or the need for more involved data preparation to present them accurately.
* Mudd made some generalizing assumptions documented in *A Comprehensive dataset for Australian mine production 1799 to 2021* and in the master spreadsheet; see [From the Notes sheet]

If any numbers seem wildly erroneous, please let me know.

## Pointers

Special thanks to Jeremy Singer-Vine for mentioning this data set in his [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com) newsletter 2023.07.12 edition

And lastly, if you visit Sydney, I highly recommend the [Australian Museum](https://australian.museum/exhibition/minerals/) where (among other things) you can "be dazzled by over 1800 spectacular rocks and minerals."
